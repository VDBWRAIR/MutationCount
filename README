MutationCount
=============

Count Mutations between a reference sequence and aligned sequences

Based on a given reference(--subject) sequence file, align all query sequences to that subject
and count the differences in the alignment.

Blastn seems to be the fastest way to do these quick alignments so it is attempted first. If it fails
then t_coffee is used.
